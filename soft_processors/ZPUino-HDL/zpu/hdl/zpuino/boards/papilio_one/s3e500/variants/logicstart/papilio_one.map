Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:   25
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         2,178 out of   9,312   23%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,705 out of   9,312   39%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,651 out of   4,656   56%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,651 out of   2,651 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,651   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,989 out of   9,312   42%
    Number used as logic:             3,618
    Number used as a route-thru:        284

      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      71

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
